After going through the problem statement.
First I thought of the project and application name as: FurnitureFactory & TableFactory respectively.
I started planning for the database, how will the tables look like and how many tables will be required and how they will be related.
As per problem statement, for Feet and Legs table we will have to create many to many relationship.
While for Table and Legs tables we will have to create one to one mapping as the leg can be assigned to only one table.
